Implement PRDs aggregation-endpoints and dockerise

Implement PRDs one at a time, ensuring each PRD is implemented in its own commit.
Strictly follow the details and requirements specified in each PRD file.

- {prd-file}.md

For each PRD: Keep code, tests, and documentation clean, minimal, and aligned with the project’s best practices.

- Always keep the existing documentation, scripts and samples: `SPEC.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `README.md`, `USAGE.md`, `install.sh` and `samples/*` in sync with code changes
