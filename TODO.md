- **Soft Deletes:** A `deleted_at` column support so data isn't permanently lost immediately. 
- **Batch Operations:** Bulk `Create`, `Update`, or `Delete` APIs. Creating 100 products one by one is slow.
- **Aggregation:** Endpoints for `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`. (Critical for dashboards/analytics).
- **Relations / Population:** Fetching related data (e.g., "Get Product **and** its Author"). Currently requires multiple API calls.
- **Dockerise:** Create a Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- Create a way mechism
